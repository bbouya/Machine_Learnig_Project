# Stock pice Prediction using machine learning: 

Prediction the stock market is one of the most important application of machine learning in finance, in this repo, I will take you through a simple data science on stock price prediction
At the end of this repo, we will learn how to predict stock prices by using the linear model by implementing the python prog langu.

## Stock price prediction
Predicting the stock market has beed the bane and goal of investors since its inception, Every day billion of dollars are traded on the stock exhange, and behind every dollars is an investor hoping to make a profit in one way or anather.

Entire companies rise and fall daily depending on market behaviour, if an inestor is able to accurately predict market movement.

Today, so many people are making money stayin at home trading in the stock market, it is a plus point for you if you use your experience in the stock market and your machine learning skills for the task of the stock price prediction.

Let's see how to predict stock price using machine learning and the python programming language, i will start this task by importing all necessary python library.

# Data preparation : 
In the above section, i started the task of stock price prediction by importing the python library. Now I will writ function named prepare_data() that will prepare the dataset so that we can fi it easily in the linear Regression Model.

## Proposal for Predicting Stock Prices Using LSTM

The challenge of this projects is to accurately predict the future closing value of a given stock across a given period of time in the future,
##### Goals : 
Explore stock prices.
Implement basic model using linear regression
Implement LSTM using keras library
Compare the results and submit the report.
## Datasets and inputs 
I will be using the daily price of the S&P 500 from Junuary 2000 to June 2017, this is a series of data points indexed in time order or time series, My goal will be to predict the closing price for any given date after training, All of the necessary data for the project will come from google finance.
## Solution statement :
For this project according to my research the best possible solution is to utilize a LSTM Neural net model capable of learning from time series data, this project will be programmed in a Jupyeter notebook(Anaconda)
## Project design
this project will be implemented through the keras/tensorflow Library using LSTM Neural networks, Development Workflow will follow the below sequence :
    set up Infrastructure
    prepare datasets
    Develope Benchmark Model 
    Develop Basic LSTM model 
    Improve LSTM Model
    Document and visualize Results
